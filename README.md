# HowIsItGoingBot

Made just for fun, for my friends who think I don't care about them.

You have to add \Local\Settings.cs file to use the bot:


> namespace HowIsItGoingBot.Local
> 
>{
>
>     internal static class Settings
>
>      {
>
>        internal const string Token = <Your_bot_token_here>;
>
>      }
>
> }
